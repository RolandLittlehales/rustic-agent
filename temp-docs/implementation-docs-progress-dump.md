- **1.2**: 2,050 LOC (Error Handling + Model Config)
- **1.3**: 2,200 LOC (Tool Results + Feedback Loop) 
- **1.5**: 2,500 LOC (Configuration System)

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Rust Code Standards
- Use async/await patterns throughout
- Implement proper error handling with the unified framework from 1.2
- Follow Tauri v2 command patterns (object parameters, not primitives)
- Use Arc<RwLock<>> for shared state management
- Apply security-first design with whitelist validation

### Integration Requirements
- All tools must integrate with the ContentBlock system from 1.1
- Error handling must use the unified framework from 1.2
- Tool execution must use the result handling system from 1.3
- Streaming must build on the foundation from 1.4
- Configuration must use the system from 1.5

### Security Focus
- Computer use and code execution require explicit user consent
- All file operations must respect whitelist configuration
- API keys stored securely with AES-256-GCM encryption
- Sandbox isolation for potentially dangerous operations
- Audit logging for all security-relevant events

## Resume Instructions

To continue this work:

1. **Complete Phase 3 Issues** - Resume with creating 3.1-3.5 implementation documents using the same comprehensive format and Task agent approach

2. **Create Phase 4 Enhancement Packages** - Create 4.1-4.4 documents focusing on production readiness and enterprise features

3. **Review and Validation Phase**:
   - Individual ticket sanity checks for completeness and accuracy
   - Collective review to identify gaps and inconsistencies  
   - Large ticket identification and splitting recommendations
   - Cross-reference link validation and addition
   - Final consistency and quality validation

4. **File Organization**:
   - All issue docs go in `/home/rolan/code/agent/docs/issues/`
   - Follow naming pattern: `{issue-number}-{brief-description}.md`
   - Maintain cross-references to implementation-sequencing.md

5. **Quality Standards**:
   - Each document should be production-ready specifications
   - Include comprehensive code examples and architecture diagrams
   - Maintain ~1,500 LOC target (flag if >2000 LOC)
   - Ensure proper integration with all existing systems

## Tools and Approach

- **Use Task tool** for creating multiple documents in parallel (efficient for bulk creation)
- **Use Write tool** for individual document creation when detailed control needed
- **Use Read tool** to verify existing documents and dependencies
- **Follow the established format** from 1.1-enhanced-contentblock-system.md as the gold standard

The goal is to create a complete set of implementation documents that transform the current basic Tauri agent into a sophisticated, production-ready AI coding assistant that rivals commercial solutions while maintaining desktop security and control.
