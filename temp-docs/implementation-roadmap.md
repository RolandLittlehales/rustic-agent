# Implementation Roadmap for Advanced Anthropic Integration

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research of Anthropic's technical documentation and AmpCode's implementation patterns, this roadmap outlines the technical requirements to transform our basic Tauri agent into a best-in-class developer-focused AI assistant. The implementation follows a structured approach with ~1500 lines of code per issue, organized into coherent feature packages that build upon each other through progressive integration.

## Phase 1: Core Anthropic Integration Upgrade

### 1.1 Type System Overhaul
**Priority: Critical**
- Replace current basic types with complete Anthropic API type system
- Implement proper content block handling (text, tool_use, tool_result)
- Add streaming response types and handlers
- Update tool definition system to match Anthropic schemas

**Technical Requirements:**
```rust
// Current: Basic string-based messages
// Target: Full content block system with proper typing
pub enum ContentBlock {
    Text { text: String },
    ToolUse { id: String, name: String, input: Value },
    ToolResult { tool_use_id: String, content: Option<String>, is_error: Option<bool> },
}
```

### 1.2 Enhanced Tool System
**Priority: Critical**
- Implement versioned tool support (computer_20250124, text_editor_20250429)
- Add parallel tool execution capabilities
- Integrate advanced tool types (computer use, text editor, code execution)
- Implement tool chaining and orchestration

**Key Features:**
- Tool versioning and compatibility management
- Parallel execution with proper error handling
- Advanced schema validation with nested objects/arrays
- Tool result caching and optimization

### 1.3 Streaming Implementation
**Priority: High**
- Server-sent events (SSE) for real-time responses
- Partial message streaming with UI updates
- Tool execution during streaming
- Performance optimization for desktop applications

## Phase 2: Advanced Features Integration

### 2.1 Computer Use Tool
**Priority: High**
- Screenshot capture and analysis
- Mouse/keyboard automation
- Screen coordinate system integration
- Security sandboxing for desktop interactions

**Technical Implementation:**
```rust
pub struct ComputerUseTool {
    version: String, // "computer_20250124"
    screen_capture: ScreenCaptureService,
    input_handler: InputHandler,
}
```

### 2.2 Text Editor Tool
**Priority: Medium**
- Advanced file editing capabilities
- Exact text replacement with validation
- Undo/redo functionality
- Integration with existing file system tools

### 2.3 Code Execution Tool
**Priority: Medium**
- Python code execution in sandboxed environment
- Integration with local development workflow
- Result visualization and data analysis
- Security isolation for code execution

## Phase 3: Developer Experience Enhancements

### 3.1 Context Management
**Priority: High**
- Project-specific context (CLAUDE.md equivalent)
- File change tracking and semantic understanding
- Thread management with context compression
- Memory system for long-term interactions

**Architecture:**
```rust
pub struct ContextManager {
    project_context: ProjectContext,
    conversation_history: ConversationHistory,
    file_watcher: FileWatcherService,
    memory_store: MemoryStore,
}
```

### 3.2 Configuration System
**Priority: Medium**
- Model selection and parameters
- Tool configuration and enablement
- Security settings and access control
- Performance tuning parameters

**Configuration Structure:**
```toml
[anthropic]
model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.7
streaming = true

[tools]
computer_use = { enabled = true, version = "computer_20250124" }
text_editor = { enabled = true, version = "text_editor_20250429" }
code_execution = { enabled = false, sandbox = "strict" }

[security]
whitelist_validation = true
max_file_size = "10MB"
allowed_operations = ["read", "write", "execute"]
```

### 3.3 User Interface Improvements
**Priority: Medium**
- Real-time streaming UI updates
- Tool execution visualization
- File explorer integration with AI context
- Debug and monitoring capabilities

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
**Priority: High**
- HTTP connection pooling and keepalive
- Response caching and optimization
- Parallel request handling
- Memory usage optimization

### 4.2 Error Handling and Reliability
**Priority: Critical**
- Comprehensive error recovery
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker patterns for API failures
- Graceful degradation strategies

### 4.3 Security Hardening
**Priority: Critical**
- Enhanced whitelist system
- API key security improvements
- Sandbox isolation for tool execution
- Audit logging and monitoring

## Technical Architecture Comparison

### Current State
```rust
// Simple tool trait
trait AgentTool {
    async fn execute(&self, input: Value) -> Result<String>;
}

// Basic message handling
struct Conversation {
    messages: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Target State
```rust
// Advanced tool system
trait AnthropicTool {
    fn version(&self) -> &str;
    fn schema(&self) -> ToolInputSchema;
    async fn execute(&self, input: Value) -> Result<ToolResult>;
    fn supports_parallel(&self) -> bool;
}

// Rich message system
struct ConversationManager {
    messages: Vec<Message>,
    tool_registry: ToolRegistry,
    streaming_handler: StreamingHandler,
    context_manager: ContextManager,
}
```
