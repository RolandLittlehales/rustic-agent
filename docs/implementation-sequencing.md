The implementation spans 15 core issues (Phases 1-3) plus 4 enhancement packages (Phase 4), targeting ~1500 LOC per issue. The critical path requires 6-8 weeks with optimal parallelization, assuming 2-3 developers.

## 1. Dependency Analysis

### Phase 1: Foundation (Issues 1.1-1.5)

## 3. Critical Path Analysis

### Minimum Timeline (Sequential Development)

```
Phase 1: 5 issues × 3 days = 15 days (3 weeks)
Phase 2: 5 issues × 3 days = 15 days (3 weeks)
Phase 3: 5 issues × 3 days = 15 days (3 weeks)
Phase 4: 4 packages × 5 days = 20 days (4 weeks)
Total: 13 weeks (sequential)
```

### Optimized Timeline (Parallel Development)

```
With 3 developers:
Phase 1: 2 weeks (parallel tracks)
Phase 2: 2 weeks (parallel tracks)
Phase 3: 2 weeks (parallel tracks)
Phase 4: 2 weeks (can start early)
Total: 6-8 weeks (with overlap)
```

### Critical Path Items

1. 1.1 ContentBlock → 1.2 Tool Execution → 2.1 Stream Processing
2. 1.3 State Management → 2.3 Configuration → 3.4 System Tools
3. 1.4 Error Handling → 1.5 Testing → 2.5 Integration Tests

## 4. Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Team Structure

**Ideal Team Composition:**

## 6. Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: ContentBlock/Streaming Integration**
- **Mitigation**: Design streaming interfaces early in 1.1
- **Contingency**: Simplified streaming in 2.1 if needed

**Risk 2: State Management Concurrency**
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing in 1.5
- **Contingency**: Simplify to single-threaded if issues

**Risk 3: Tool Interface Evolution**
- **Mitigation**: Stable interface by end of Phase 1
- **Contingency**: Version tool interfaces if changes needed

### Schedule Risks

**Risk 1: Dependencies Between Tracks**
- **Mitigation**: Clear interface definitions upfront
- **Contingency**: Mock interfaces for parallel development

**Risk 2: Integration Delays**
- **Mitigation**: Weekly integration points
- **Contingency**: Dedicated integration sprints

**Risk 3: Testing Bottlenecks**
- **Mitigation**: Continuous testing from Week 2
- **Contingency**: Additional QA resources

### Mitigation Strategies

**1. Interface Contracts:**
- Define all interfaces in Week 1
- Create mock implementations
- Version all API contracts

**2. Continuous Integration:**
- Automated CI from Day 1
- Integration tests for each merge
- Performance benchmarks

**3. Buffer Management:**
